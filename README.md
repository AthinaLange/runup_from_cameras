Do NOT run this as one code. There are three sections that require other steps be taken in between. 
1a) Compute ARGUS camera extrinsics
1b) Define timestacks and get .pix file for i2R system
------ camera acquires timestacks -----
2) extract timestacks from i2R product
------ run segmentation_gym on images -----
3a) extract horizontal runup line from segmented image
3b) project horizontal runup line onto MOPS vertical elevation
